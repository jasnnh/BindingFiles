Hide files within an image or another file

Hiding files within another file has a lot of benefits, one is security wise it does add another layer of protection as this file doesn't look out of place.
and to the normal eye you wouldn't think much of it until you look a little further and check the header of the file only to find out it has zip compression tag.

In this example we binded the .zip file which contains a text file with fake bank information with an image file the new image can be viewed
as an image file however we can also treat the image file as a .zip and open it as one using a program to unzip or unrar of our choice.

the code used in this example is MS-DOS, MS-DOS is a Windows CLI code and the main code for this example is copy /b.
